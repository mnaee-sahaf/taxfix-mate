## **1. Tax Rates and Structure**

Pakistan’s income tax system distinguishes between salaried individuals and non-salaried individuals or associations of persons (AOPs).

- **PKR 1,200,000–2,200,000**: PKR 30,000 + 15% on the excess over PKR 1,200,000.
- **PKR 2,200,000–3,200,000**: PKR 180,000 + 25% on the excess over PKR 2,200,000.
- **PKR 3,200,000–4,100,000**: PKR 430,000 + 30% on the excess over PKR 3,200,000.

### **1.2 Tax Rates for Non-Salaried Individuals and AOPs**

For **non-salaried individuals** and AOPs, the tax structure is different, with higher thresholds and rates[^1][^2]:

- **PKR 1,200,000–1,600,000**: PKR 90,000 + 20% on the excess over PKR 1,200,000.
- **PKR 1,600,000–3,200,000**: PKR 170,000 + 30% on the excess over PKR 1,600,000.
- **PKR 3,200,000–5,600,000**: PKR 650,000 + 40% on the excess over PKR 3,200,000.
- **Above PKR 5,600,000**: PKR 1,610,000 + 45% on the excess over PKR 5,600,000.


### **1.3 Additional Surcharges and Provisions**

- **10% Surcharge**: Individuals and AOPs with taxable income exceeding PKR 10 million annually must pay a surcharge equal to 10% of their income tax[^1].

## **3. Tax Filing Process and Digital Tools**

### **3.1 Digital Filing Platforms**

The **Tax Asaan App** (developed by the FBR) offers a streamlined filing process[^5]:

1. **Registration**: Users input CNIC, mobile number, and email for verification.
2. **Profile Management**: Update personal and financial details.
3. **Tax Return Selection**: Choose the appropriate form based on income type (salary, business, etc.).
4. **Income/Expense Entry**:
    - Salaried individuals can auto-import data if employers are FBR-registered.
    - Manually input deductions (e.g., medical expenses, donations).
5. **Tax Calculation and Payment**: The app auto-calculates tax liability and allows online payment via banking options.
6. **Submission**: Finalize and submit the return, with an acknowledgment receipt generated automatically[^5].

### **3.2 Key Features for a Tax Filing App**

## **4. Common Challenges and Loopholes**

### **4.1 Tax Evasion and Legal Gaps**

- **Benami Transactions**: Anonymous property transactions, prohibited under the 2016 Benami Transactions Act, remain unaddressed due to lack of secondary regulations[^3].
- **Prize Bonds**: Tax-exempt and anonymous, often used to launder unexplained income[^3].
- **Low Tax Morale**: Citizens view indirect taxes (e.g., sales tax) as primary obligations, undermining direct tax compliance[^3].


### **4.2 Structural Issues in Taxation**

- **Regressive Tax System**: Heavy reliance on indirect taxes (e.g., sales tax, customs) disproportionately affects lower-income groups[^3].
- **Withholding Tax Dependency**: Over 60% of income tax is collected through withholding agents (banks, telecoms), limiting FBR’s ability to identify unregistered taxpayers[^3].

## **6. Conclusion and Recommendations**

### **6.1 Synthesis of Findings**

Pakistan’s tax system for individuals is progressive but faces challenges in compliance due to legal loopholes and low tax morale. Salaried individuals benefit from lower tax rates and auto-filled data, while non-salaried taxpayers face steeper rates. Digital tools like the Tax Asaan App have simplified filing but require enhanced features for broader adoption.

### **6.2 Recommendations for App Development**

- **Educational Modules**: Include FAQs, tax-saving tips, and explanations of filer vs. non-filer status.
- **Multi-Lingual Support**: Local languages to cater to less literate users.
- **Audit Risk Assessment**: Flag transactions that may trigger audits (e.g., high cash deposits).
- **Benami Warning System**: Alert users about anonymous transactions and recommend documentation.

By addressing these aspects, a tax filing app can not only simplify compliance but also empower users to navigate Pakistan’s tax landscape effectively.
